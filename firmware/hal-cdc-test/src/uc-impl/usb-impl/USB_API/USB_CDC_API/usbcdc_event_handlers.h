//
//! Indicates Data has been Received for CDC Interface
//!
//! \param intfNum is which CDC interface is being used.
//! 
//! This event indicates that data has been received for CDC interface intfNum
//! with no receive operation underway. Effectively, the API doesn???t know what
//! to do with this data and is asking for instructions. The application can
//! respond by either initiating a receive operation or rejecting the data.
//! Until one of these is performed, USB data reception cannot continue; any
//! packets received from the USB host will be NAK???ed.
//! 
//! Therefore, this event should be handled quickly. A receive operation cannot
//! be started directly out of this event, since USBCDC_receiveData() cannot be
//! called from the event handlers. However, the handler can set a flag for
//! main() to begin the receive operation. After this function exits, a call to
//! USBCDC_getInterfaceStatus() for this CDC interface will return kUSBDataWaiting.
//! 
//! If the application is written so that a receive operation is always begun
//! prior to data arriving from the host, this event will never occur. The
//! software designer generally has a choice of whether to use this event as
//! part of code flow (initiating receive operations after data is received), or
//! to always keep a receive operation open in case data arrives. (See Sec. 11
//! of \e "Programmer???s Guide: MSP430 USB API Stack for CDC/PHDC/HID/MSC" for
//! more discussion.)

//!
//! \param intfNum is which CDC interface is being used.
//! 
//! 
//! This event indicates that a send operation on CDC interface intfNum has just
//! been completed. 
//! 
//! In applications sending a series of data blocks, the designer may wish
//! to use this event to trigger another send operation. This cannot be done
//! directly out of this event, since USBCDC_sendData() cannot be called 
//! from the event handlers. However, the handler can set a flag for main()
//! to begin the operation.

//! \return FALSE to go asleep after interrupt (in the case the CPU slept before

//! Receive Operation on CDC Interface has Completed
//!
//! \param intfNum is which HID interface is being used.
//! 
//! This event indicates that a receive operation on CDC interface intfNum has
//! just been completed, and the data is therefore available in the user buffer
//! assigned when the call was made to USBCDC_receiveData(). If this event
//! occurs, it means that the entire buffer is full, according to the size value
//! that was requested.
//! 
//! The designer may wish to use this event to trigger another receive
//! operation. This cannot be done directly out of this event, since
//! USBCDC_receiveData() cannot be called from the event handlers. However, the
//! handler can set a flag for main() to begin the operation.
//! 
//! \return FALSE to go asleep after interrupt (in the case the CPU slept before
